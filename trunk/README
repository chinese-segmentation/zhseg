Stupid, small dynamic programming Chinese word segmenter.  But it's very
fast and lightweight, which makes it potentially useful even if it's not
fancy.  Input must be in UTF-8 encoding.

The segmentation proceeds according to the following rules:

  1) Punctuation is always segmented.
  2) Existing spaces are always segmented.
  3) Highest frequency path is chosen, but longer words are favored over
     shorter words.

To run it:

  % make
  % ./zhseg Mandarin.fre < unsegmented.txt > segmented.txt

The frequency dictionary was downloaded from the LDC's Chinese resources
page, http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/Chinese/LDC_ch.htm .

The UTF-8 library has its own copyright and license.
